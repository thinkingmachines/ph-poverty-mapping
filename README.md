# Philippine Poverty Mapping 

This repository accompanies our research work, *"Mapping Philippine Poverty
using Machine Learning, Satellite Imagery, and Crowd-sourced Geospatial
Information"*, currently published in our
[website](https://stories.thinkingmachin.es/philippines-most-vulnerable-communities/).

## Setup

In order to run the notebooks, all dependencies must be installed. We provided
a `Makefile` to accomplish this task:

```
make venv
make build
```

This creates a virtual environment, `venv`, and installs all dependencies found
in `requirements.txt`.
